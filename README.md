## Introduction 

This is a react project which shows the menu items of  a restaurant. It can dynamically render the different category buttons and is in sync with data.
This is a clone of John Smilga"s project.

## Functionality :
The filterCategory() function takes in a string of the the category which should be filtered and rendered.

The var menuCategories is used to store the different menu category and the JavaScript Set method is used to ensure unique values are returned.

images in this project were gotten from the internet and I'm in no way licensed to ownership.
